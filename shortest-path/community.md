## Setting Up Community Tasks

Community tasks are managed by “`Sector`” units. The strength of Sectors lies in their ability to efficiently organize your created tasks, enabling users to quickly find and complete desired tasks upon entering your community.&#x20;

Leveraging Sectors effectively establishes a _clear user guidance path_, using a structured task classification system that progresses from simple to complex, guiding users to engage with your product in an immersive, step-by-step manner.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdJRcpjpN4WkG1u_cLmG1HbeEzzvDC9EVgECKgXzKgRpmUGNevsf0Wpy9MWDvt3gpwHmxnTY9DNq83PZllsYikfvDtI6TPoT-R5qod0ne4hO1n4PecuhhMBxZbzlHicl-ghFGdAHg?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Community tasks are divided into three main categories: `Onchain`, `OffChain`, and `API`. Task rewards are tied to the community points system, with the option to set daily tasks. To add a task, click `Add New Task` within the relevant Sector.

### OffChain Tasks

OffChain tasks primarily include: `Daily Connect`, `Invite`, `X`, `Discord`, `Telegram`, `YouTube`, `Facebook`, `Instagram`, `Reddit`, `Email`,`Visit Website` , `Education`,`QA`,`Proof of Work`,`Quiz`,`Survey`,`Medium`,`Share`,`Twitch`,`AMA`.&#x20;

Task activities typically involve following, reposting, navigating to web pages for learning, or completing quizzes.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdvfXvjho7UcGQeGv-FlAgA50efTnpCfPjY-tO0FABtZikQEjyKZsU4cUuDPFh59lMk5oAfBTJBnCQnQIw89nTZ7ZaKm4b4D2v1zwiVSH6Kaz7f94TkWRuHTdKa984vgKtvO0-M?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The system has integrated nearly all common Web3 social media tasks.&#x20;

For example, with X (Twitter) tasks, project teams can set rewards for task completion based on their community points system or token incentives.

For X tasks, common activities include following, liking, retweeting, or posting specific content, which are mainstream and nearly essential task types.

If certain task instructions are not easily conveyed, you can use the detailed content description in the task module to communicate requirements to users.

For Telegram tasks, deploying a bot enables faster automated verification.

### OnChain Tasks&#x20;

OnChain Tasks include: `Wallet Balance`, `Smart Contract`, `Gas Related`, `Uniswap`, `Pancakeswap`, `Curve`, `Metis`, `Nibiru`, `Chainge`, `AAVE`, `Compound`, `Raydium`, `Aerodrome`, `TaskOn Aggregator`.

The task modules include Hold,Swap, LP, Stake, Lending and Borrowing,Verification,etc.

All OnChain tasks should consider user participation costs and establish appropriate incentive systems to maintain sustained user engagement.

**Identity Verification Tasks**: Using the _Wallet Balance_ template, you can restrict tasks to users holding specific tokens or NFTs.&#x20;

The _Gas Related Task_ template verifies on-chain identity, allowing only users who have spent a certain amount of gas fees on a specified chain to participate in target tasks.

**Hold Tasks**: Set requirements for users to hold a specific number of tokens or NFTs on a designated Network.

**Swap Tasks**: Select the required Network, specify the tokens to swap from and to, and set the minimum value requirement and transaction count.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe42zVBFw4GDaQ4DtOfpaYqBd9E3vlKX6IGbJTNHPI_BYGnVq5hlIKXMquf4T9imbdX9pTybueYPph4YXdyju-5xCaZKArxWZG1Ps1iyPCEsuUjozGLQNqkf4ij7vu3r5RciB6kvA?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**LP Tasks**: Provide a task description, select the required Network, choose the trading pair (quote token and base token), and set the minimum value requirement and transaction count.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfOYHvXy0tiYuZunXpRumb7zQ3YCsuqe1I5Bt4SxidnLXcpwdlofesxG8clDkx2QEGOu7tCuX5MIuyK6kZD0RqVhn6oerMDHc5YcKwHWYE0kK9yV0tALA7wlWSbAdXac9xTag7pWg?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Stake Tasks**: Provide a task description, select the required Chain, and specify the minimum staking amount.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcV7vubGYOe0iJxQVcPUWOT2b6hFI5Z88t1nushjmH4cmTDb-6-ubrr9I_HohpSrYjkcKbtKhAnlxCDJDAORvgqoh752ciRAKdQOvjh9nRHoSPnqEzEFGOa7oZXhJuBWP0zZo20AQ?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### API Tasks：

API tasks rely on APIs provided by the project team to return whether a user has completed a specified task and to send task completion data back to TaskOn.

TaskOn enables seamless integration of APIs with various applications and functions to verify whether participants are using your product or specific features, including but not limited to liquidity provision, borrowing, supplying, mining, and swapping.

To use an _API-Verified Task_, you must provide a Task Description and configure the API URL.

TaskOn’s API verification task feature integrates APIs from various applications and functions. When setting up API-verified tasks, first select between `Performance-Based API Task` and `Completion-Based API Task`.

`Performance-Based API Task`: Focuses on task completion status, verified through an API interface. Project teams can indicate which wallet addresses have completed the task. Behaviors such as app downloads or user registrations can be rewarded through API settings in this module.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfY1C5RdjicocTjzoRdCdEnVK1hd9TVjBCKbXrdW9evpQzJKuco6M9CMp5LpIAJDwrAfmOZfxpzOxVRJyYsfJ4TIOn26z8cUwQkukbK4xtKm3DZ_Zwh1oU3emd9AOt89TGzhRGqIQ?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`Completion-Based API Task`: Focuses on dynamic point rewards. Project teams can set periodic reward actions via the API interface to specify which user actions qualify for ongoing rewards.&#x20;

For example, requiring users to log into your official account daily or perform interactions on your website, with different interactions yielding different rewards, can be configured through this API module.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfN774Rt60O-2qCyTcpvV3Y2hiPnB8clmIexxlUGOuzC01FlRSFB2fm-9Jh8Acw5baKY3WT1M17OJy3U20rfXBmRde-s95ulIRO0Diu2GN6boR0nvqvmkl03qcB0izyoCKK-7TTlA?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 1:**

Set the API URL: Choose between social media accounts or wallet addresses and input the API address.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdoZ6z5k0-8177KqeC5TChrNaHYS2St8et621HDtheJgWj0HZ52pJxYEzxyLEgCY-Vgn9y5rcwWEW4VwhnAQNHcpAa1syT8ysySm7urnkm18Hd7ObhpVswlLuKNTNM8N49b9z2CbA?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select the user identification type (wallet address type or user ID type) and provide a valid API URL for task verification. The API URL must comply with [TaskOn API Verification Guide.](https://versed-catshark-f4d.notion.site/TaskOn-API-Verification-Guide-1f854c607cd349948c8db6f108fc39f1)<br>

**Step 2:**&#x20;

Verification Configuration and Wallet Address Input\
For `Completion-Based API Tasks`, you can upload lists of qualified and unqualified wallet addresses. For `Performance-Based API Tasks`, only qualified wallet addresses are required. The system needs qualified wallet addresses to mark eligibility, automatically recording verified addresses.&#x20;

Rewards are distributed based on associated addresses, while effective data isolation is maintained at the data layer, generating a participation data dashboard.

Note: It is recommended to prioritize the _Smart Contract_ module in the OnChain task template for smart contract configurations. If your API interface cannot be matched, please contact us to address specific issues.

## Points System

Community task setups primarily revolve around the points system and daily tasks.

The points system is the cornerstone of the community, effectively sustaining user engagement enthusiasm. On the TaskOn platform, project teams can establish multiple points systems to achieve diverse reward objectives.

The points system allows for level configurations, specifying how many points are earned per task and how many points are required to advance to the next level. Points and levels serve as indicators of users’ contributions to the community. Communities can distribute rewards based on levels, such as token rewards, whitelist or airdrop eligibility, exclusive NFT distribution, or Discord role assignments.

For example, you can configure a default reward of 10 points per completed task, with 500 points required to advance one level. Level progression does not need to be linear and can be freely customized. The level-up curve should be designed based on task difficulty, with the core goal of determining how many tasks a user must complete to become an influential community contributor. This approach informs the reward structure for users at different levels.

Rewards for community members are primarily distributed through points redemption or can be integrated into lucky wheel draws to increase points utilization.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcxiurvB8isSAvAgPXyxUqa7Tjeto4NmA4pWzpry3AcCi_JHrW6x4F60uFFTFUhuAlTIm46oUuv74hZfzb-R5JvTdT7VYVQBji8ehNw-xfR5NtDjFpfuDRzQmyitJLKbwLrkVu-Mw?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Additionally, communities can configure multiple points systems. By clicking _Add Points System_ on top of an existing system, you can create a second points system to support varied reward structures.

## Leaderboard

The Leaderboard is divided into three main sections: _Points_, _Quest_, and _Incentives_. All leaderboard data can be exported as files.

Points: Tracks point accumulation within the community, reflecting the contribution leaderboard. It can be pinned to the community homepage for users to have an intuitive sense of their contributions.

Quest Leaderboard: Displays user reward rankings for each specific Quest.

Incentives: Represents the reward system created for users; see the Incentives System for details.

## Incentives System

To enhance user participation and activity, TaskOn has introduced an “Incentives Mechanism.” This feature allows projects to designate a specific time period during which users must complete particular tasks or meet specific conditions to earn time-limited rewards. This mechanism not only encourages more active participation but also creates a sense of urgency.

This setup is ideal for seasonal or short-term leaderboards.\
The Incentives System is suitable for adding token and USDT rewards, effectively granting benefits to high-point users.
