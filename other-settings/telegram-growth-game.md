Click `Telegram Growth Game` to access the feature, where you can invite users to join a lucky wheel to win rewards. You can share the invitation via social media platforms such as X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, or directly copy the link for sharing.

In the `View` section below, you can configure the Telegram group by entering your Telegram group link. The TaskOn community is checked by default.

When a user joins your Telegram group and TaskOn’s Telegram group, they earn 1 spin. For each invited user who joins both your Telegram group and TaskOn’s Telegram group, the inviter earns 1 spin.

Set the duration for users to spin and earn rewards, and configure the spin rewards. The system backend will automatically generate a dynamic reward mechanism. If any rewards remain undistributed, they will be refunded to your account.

Once the set time is reached, the system will automatically distribute the rewards. Here, you only need to configure the specific network, token, and total reward amount, and deposit the funds. The system will split the total rewards accordingly.

The system will only count users who join or are invited to your Telegram group during the reward distribution period.
