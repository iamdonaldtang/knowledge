# White-Label

TaskOn's new white-label service utilizes iframe technology to achieve "deep embedded integration," seamlessly incorporating the powerful `GTC` into your official website without redirection. This creates a community service with a fully unified brand experience and a naturally integrated user flow. By landing on your website, users can automatically log in to GTC and join directly.

Community tasks such as `TaskChain`, and `Multi-Day Challenge` are designed to educate users and cultivate habits through daily check-ins, an "educate-then-answer" approach, and continuous task chains.

Your users can perform functions like binding, unbinding, and withdrawals without needing to visit the TaskOn platform.

#### I. Core Features: Seamless Integrated Experience

**A. Deep Visual and Interactive Unity**

* Embedded Integration: Using an `iframe` embedding solution, GTC loads as a page within your official website. The styling differs from TaskOn and is highly aligned with your site’s design.
* Navigation Bar: When users access the GTC page, your project’s top navigation bar remains, completely eliminating the disjointed feeling of "redirecting to an external site."
* Fully Customizable Styling: We offer highly customizable GTC styling to ensure perfect consistency with your website’s design language (color scheme, fonts, spacing).

**B. Seamless User Login System**

* Automatic Login & Joining: After logging into your website, users are automatically authenticated and joined when accessing the GTC page, with no need for a second login.
* Unified Authorization Management: Authorization pop-ups for key operations (e.g., accessing the personal center, binding accounts) will match your login method (wallet/email), ensuring a consistent interactive experience.

**C. Function Tailoring and Customization**

To align with your business scenario, the embedded GTC interface has been carefully optimized:

* Streamlined Interface: The top banner area has been removed, and the "Quest" and "Event" tabs have been eliminated, focusing the interface on core task functions.

* Rewards Overview Entry: A user rewards summary bar has been added above the tabs; clicking it redirects to the personal center, continuously incentivizing user participation.
* Configurable Wallet Functions: GTC’s Swap function involves disconnecting and switching wallets. These features can be made configurable, allowing projects to flexibly show or hide them as needed.
* Avatar Elements Removed: To avoid conflicts with avatars set by projects, all avatars in GTC—including those in `Incentive`, `Leaderboard`, and `Benefits Shop` sections—have been removed.

* Mini Personal Center Removed: As a widget version of the mini personal center has been redesigned for the white-label GTC, the originally hidden mini personal center in the community section has been removed.

#### II. More Integrated Functional Components, De-"TaskOn-ization"

**A. Embedded User Center**

* The Assets tab is integrated into the white-label GTC.&#x20;
* The Rewards History and Activity History tabs remain unchanged.

In the personal center, users can view:

* Asset Overview: Check claimable and already claimed rewards.
* Direct Withdrawal: Complete reward withdrawals without returning to the TaskOn main site.
* Transaction History Query: Full record of all reward transactions.
* Clicking "`Edit Profile`" leads to the white-label version of the Profile page.

**1.White-label Profile Page**

Only the display, binding, and unbinding of the following accounts are retained. The accounts shown are configurable based on the project’s main login method.

As white-label services mostly use wallet login, unbinding is disabled by default.

**2.Mini Widget User Center**

* Persistent Sidebar Placement: A lightweight widget appears on the right sidebar of all pages on your website, constantly displaying the user’s reward status and task progress.
* Smart Reward Notifications: When users interact with your smart contract (e.g., completing a transaction, providing liquidity), the widget proactively sends notifications guiding them to claim rewards, significantly boosting conversion rates.

**B.  User Habit-Building Tools**

* **TaskChain**: Introduces the concept of task chains with an "educate-then-answer" approach, designing progressive consecutive tasks that guide users to learn product knowledge while offering reward incentives.
* **Multi-Day Challenge**: Sets up multi-day task challenges to motivate sustained participation, effectively cultivating loyal user habits from "first contact" to "deep usage."

#### III. Permissions and Security Controls

We adhere to the principle of "trusting the project" and have designed an intelligent permission flow:

* Smooth Experience for New Users: New users coming from your website can use functions without additional authorization, ensuring a fluid experience.
* One-Time Authorization for Existing Users: Existing TaskOn users only need to complete a one-time authorization (consistent with your site’s login method—wallet signature/email verification code) when performing key sensitive operations for the first time (e.g., switching wallets, binding/unbinding social media). Subsequent wallet switches require no repetition.

***

#### IV. Technical Architecture Advantages

* High Independence: Iframe embedding ensures the independence and stability of GTC functions without affecting the performance or security of your main website.
* No Separate Domain: The service is fully integrated under your domain, strengthening brand sovereignty and enhancing user trust.
* Configurable Deployment: Styles, function toggles, and permission rules can be flexibly configured via the backend, allowing quick adaptation to your business changes.
