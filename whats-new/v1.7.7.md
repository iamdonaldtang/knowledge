**Benefit Shop**

To further incentivize and reward active members of the projects’ community, we’re introducing the **Benefit Shop**. Upon completing tasks within the community and accumulating certain points, members can exchange them for various rewards in the Benefit Shop, including **Token**, **NFTs**, **Discord Role**, **Whitelists**, **Content**, **Promote Code** **and more**. The specific rewards are determined by the project community to ensure diversity and appeal.

The Benefit Shop not only provides rewards but also serves as recognition for members’ contributions, enhancing their sense of value and importance within the community thereby increasing loyalty. By offering valuable rewards, we encourage continued participation in community activities, fostering ongoing growth and conversion.

**Referral Program**

The Referral Program is designed to reward projects for referring their friends’ projects to register on TaskOn and become paying members. The commission rate is determined by factors such as the number of referrals and the scale of their payments.

We believe that the Referral Program will be a valuable addition to your toolkit for community growth and conversion on TaskOn. Collaborating with other projects on TaskOn can lead to mutually beneficial partnerships and collaborations, further enhancing the growth and success of your project.

_\*The referral program is exclusive to users with a community plan subscription and whitelisted users._
