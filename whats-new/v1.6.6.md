For Business-end, including:

* `Invitation Rewards Module`

The new referral reward feature aims to grow the user base and increase engagement in campaigns, events, and AMA activities. Project owners can establish referral rewards granted to users who achieve a certain number of referrals and ranking positions. In the future, the feature is not exclusive to project owners, but can also be used by third-party platforms for their own activities.

For now, only campaigns that are listed as “Upcoming” or “Ongoing” on TaskOn are supported. Only one corresponding referral reward activity is allowed per campaign, and it concludes automatically when the campaign ends. The system ranks referrers by the number of successful referrals they made, and their reward tier is determined by their exact rank.

Referrals are considered successful when the referred users complete the campaign via the referrer’s unique invitation link. The final referral count and rankings are confirmed at the end of the campaign. In situations where multiple referrers have the same referral count, precedence is given to those who reach the count first.

The reward distribution can be handled by TaskOn — with Tokens and NFTs deposited and automatically distributed based on the set rules at the end of the campaign. If no one wins in a tier, the rewards are unfrozen and returned to the project owner. Alternatively, the project owner can handle the reward distribution themselves after the campaign concludes, with TaskOn notifying them to do so.



* **Add `Space Manager`**

You now have the ability to add additional `admins` to your space, promoting a more collaborative project management approach.

Bring your team into the fold and let them create and manage campaigns and airdrops from their own accounts. Please note: You can only add new accounts as an admin and not linked accounts within our platform.
