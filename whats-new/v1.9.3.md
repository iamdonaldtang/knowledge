We are thrilled to introduce **TaskOn v1.9.3**, an exciting update that adds value for both the users and the projects. **TaskOn v1.9.3** is another milestone in our continuous efforts to streamline and enrich the user experience.

The new features in this update include but are not limited to:

* **Swap & Bridge**: now available on **TaskOn**, this feature allows our users to greatly increase their efficiency in completing Web3 quests.

* **More informative quest description**: TaskOn now supports rich text in the description field, which means that the users are provided with more instructive and intuitive descriptions before they start the tasks.
* **Recurring tasks**: we have made quests that contain repeating tasks in Quest Hub, which means our users have opportunities to earn extra rewards.

* **Enhanced financial security for the projects**: previously, our projects sometimes could not identify their records of adding assets on Polygon. **TaskOn** has now introduced a self-service option that allows our projects to retrieve their unused assets, thereby alleviating their worries about financial security.

* **Editting ongoing quests**: our projects can now make necessary changes to the quests after the releases. This provides greater flexibility and chances for correcting mistakes.

* **Ranking events expanded**: we have expanded the scope of ranking events, which used to support ranking quests only. But in **TaskOn v1.9.3**, they can support any types of quests as long as they include reward points, such as Lucky Draw and FCFS.

* **More flexibility with quest launch**: in earlier versions, all quest launches had to be previously scheduled. Now, our projects have the option of publishing them immediately.
