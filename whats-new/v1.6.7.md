## New Reward Type: Points <a href="#id-9ff0" id="id-9ff0"></a>

In this version, we’ve introduced a brand-new reward type: Points. This innovative reward system adds a gamified experience to your TaskOn platform campaigns, motivating users to accomplish tasks and accumulate points. Beyond that, points offer you the capability to fashion a personalized **points system** aligned with your project’s objectives. By fine-tuning point values and redemption choices, you can amplify user engagement and nurture loyalty. Furthermore, the aggregation of user points serves as a gauge of participants’ engagement level, aiding your project in pinpointing a committed community of actively involved and supportive users.

**Set Points for Each Task**

When task settings, TaskOn offers the capability to assign varying points to individual tasks, facilitating the establishment of a finely tuned incentive mechanism. Each task carries its own unique significance and level of challenge. By allocating well-suited point values to tasks, you can realize a more precise and effective user incentive strategy.

**All Time Leaderboard**

In this new version, we introduced the leaderboard feature. Through this tool, you can obtain an overview of users who have participated in your campaigns. This helps you quickly identify users who are highly engaged and of high quality, showing a strong interest in your project. Currently, the leaderboard supports evaluating users through two key dimensions: the number of **campaigns** they participated in and the **points** they got.

After minting NFTs, we offer the **NFT distributio**n feature, enabling projects to explore inventive branding strategies and spark user engagement.
