We’re excited to announce the official release of **TaskOn v2.5**! This version delivers a brand-new **user-side UI** and deep **UX optimizations**, introduces the POX Score, and enhances gamified participation with **FCFS Smart Blind Box** — all to turn **verifiable user actions** into **measurable growth outcomes**.

The POX Score gives every user a clearer identity score and a transparent path to earning more rewards. The redesigned **Feed Flow** ranks content by functionality and intent, helping users pinpoint high-efficiency targets faster.

In addition, **FCFS Smart Blind Box** boosts playability while significantly improving anti-bot efficacy.

**Try it now and explore what’s new!**

### Feed Flow <a href="#id-0ba1" id="id-0ba1"></a>

The user homepage is rebuilt around a **Feed Flow**, dynamically surfacing high-value sections using signals like heat and quality. Key modules include: **Sprint Leaderboard**, **Token Reward**, **Well-Funded Community**, **Hot Right Now**, **POC Score Rank Up Challenge**, **Special Events**, **Ends within 3 Days**, and **On-Fire Community**.

With the new homepage, users can discover **high-ROI activities** faster, with more intuitive activity cues and guidance.

**Tips (Users)**

* Watch **“Ends within 3 Days / Hot Right Now”** to prioritize **high-reward × short-cycle** campaigns.
* Focus on the POC Rank-Up Challenge and deeper on-chain tasks to build consistency over time.
* **Follow/Star “On-Fire Community”** to establish a cadence for daily check-ins and weekly tasks.

**Tips (Projects)**

* Tune **reward structures and time windows** to increase the chance of landing in **Hot / Ends Soon** blocks.
* Place **new features / core conversion actions** into **Challenge / Sprint** modules to lift week-one acquisition.
* Pair with **Smart Blind Box** for **greater exposure** in the feed and layered rewards that amplify social reach.

### POX Score：Five-Dimensional Balance System (POH/POC/POE/POV/POS) <a href="#id-93e3" id="id-93e3"></a>

The new POX Score redefines user value and guides users toward richer rewards. With multi-dimensional cross-verification, it reduces bot presence and gives users a clear growth path: **increase your score → unlock more mechanics/rewards**.

**POX Score**

* **POH (Proof of Humanity):** Credibility signals such as wallet/social bindings and KYC.
* **POC (Proof of Contribution):** Frequency, quality, and consistency of task completion.
* **POE (Proof of Exploration):** Breadth and depth of exploration across new chains, features, and events.
* **POV (Proof of Value):** On-chain asset scale and transaction activity.
* **POS (Proof of Social):** Authentic interactions on X/Discord/Telegram.

Under this system, users receive a **composite score** that is displayed on the **Identity Leaderboard**.

_**Unlock rule:** The Pox Score features unlock only when **POH > 20**._

To raise POH: click **POH → Details**, then **bind more wallets**, **connect social accounts**, and **complete KYC**.

With Pox Score scoring, the **Leaderboard** shows user ranking, rewards earned, and tasks completed — transparent examples that teach “how to participate better and earn more.” Rewards are tilted toward **authentic** users who **explore** and **contribute**.

From the Leaderboard, you can open a user’s profile. If you suspect a bot, click **Report** to help the platform combat abuse.

**Tips (Users)**

* **First bring POH to 20+, then work on POC, POE, and POS.**
* For **POV**, start with **basic on-chain activity** (small interactions at steady frequency) and climb steadily.
* Study top profiles on the **Leaderboard** and replicate their paths.

**Tips (Projects)**

* Add **extra incentives for high-value actions** and use the Pox Score system to cultivate long-term behaviors that attract higher-quality users.

### FCFS Smart Blind Box <a href="#f33a" id="f33a"></a>

**Smart Blind Box** is TaskOn’s new **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** reward mode. After a user **completes and verifies** the required tasks, they can **open the Box** to receive a **randomized reward**.

When a project creates a **Quest**, **Smart Blind Box** is **recommended by default** as the reward configuration.

At the **claim stage**, the system performs **anti-bot checks**. Suspicious accounts are **ineligible to win**. Projects set the **total budget** and **number of winners**; at reveal, the user’s reward is **randomized around the average**.\
Budgets **≥ $100** enable **Smart Blind Box mode** with **platform traffic support** and **greater feed exposure**.

On completion, users see a **chest + key** animation. **Drag the key** to open the box and claim the reward — dramatically improving playability and reducing automated abuse.
