## **Alpha Meme** <a href="#bb30" id="bb30"></a>

Alpha Meme Signal is an on-chain monitoring tool that specializes in token scanning across multiple chains, including Solana. The system automatically detects newly emerged tokens on the blockchain and analyzes key data such as contract address (CA), token name, short-term price fluctuations, and market heat, helping users identify potential Alpha opportunities in real-time.

Whether you’re a short-term trader or a long-term investor, Alpha Meme provides the critical information you need to capitalize on the next big meme coin.

4\. Users now have the option of turning off their Google Authentication, which means that they can save time when conducting transactions.

5\. After joining a quest, the participants are now better updated on its status. That is to say, they can see when the quest will end, how large the total rewards pool is, the user’s ranking (if the distribution method is Ranking), when the winner’s list will be officially announced, who will distribute the rewards, etc. By updating the users on what is happening, this new feature will give them a stronger sense of control.

6\. In **Boost Hub**, projects can redeem their Boost vouchers on their own. The benefits include featuring their projects on Homepage/Quest Banner, featuring their communities on Community Banner, promoting their quests on TaskOn social media (X, Discord, and Telegram). This new feature will also allow our projects to directly enjoy their benefits.
