### **New Task Templates** <a href="#id-6cb1" id="id-6cb1"></a>

**Invite Friends to Discord**

Introducing our latest task template designed to boost community growth and engagement: “**Invite Friends to Discord**”. This template encourages current community members to actively invite their friends to join the project’s Discord server. By leveraging the power of personal recommendations and social connections, this task template aims to expand the community’s reach and foster a more vibrant and interactive environment.

### **Smart Tasks** <a href="#id-45d3" id="id-45d3"></a>

In addition to automatically creating tasks related to platform X, the new version of Smart Task now supports integration with Medium and Youtube.

### **Community Operator** <a href="#id-966f" id="id-966f"></a>

Our latest update introduces the “Community Operator” role to streamline community management. Now, community admin can designate multiple operators within the same community, efficiently allocating community management and activity execution responsibilities. Each operator can create tasks, and access data, contributing to enhanced collaboration efficiency.

### Onboarding Process Optimization <a href="#eea4" id="eea4"></a>

We have optimized the onboarding process where projects can input their official website URL, and the system automatically retrieves basic information for pre-filling. This reduces manual input significantly. Projects simply need to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information and make modifications as necessary. Additionally, TaskOn provides predefined community setup templates, allowing users to quickly create community tasks according to their specific needs.

### **Homepage Optimization** <a href="#c4fd" id="c4fd"></a>

In the new version, Community has introduced a brand new Homepage aimed at assisting projects in creating more comprehensive communities and managing them more efficiently. Users can now utilize the To Do List to view and address priority tasks, ensuring smooth community operations. Additionally, the Home page displays real-time updates on community-wide data changes, enabling project teams to monitor key metrics promptly and make informed decisions.

### **Task ID** <a href="#e072" id="e072"></a>

Task IDs ensure that each task has a unique identifier, facilitating easier collaboration among team members to share responsibilities and track progress. Moreover, in case of any issues with a particular task, these IDs help the development team swiftly pinpoint and trace related problems or updates.
