# Festival Marketing

## Growth Challenge

Open source is a fundamental characteristic of `Web3` projects, and the high transparency has also led to product homogenization. If the project lacks distinctive features, it may result in low `brand awareness` and increased costs in `acquiring users`. Additionally, almost all Web3 products primarily need decentralized wallets for functionality. However, a user's wallet can experience multiple projects, and creating a new wallet address incurs no cost. As a result, cultivating user loyalty becomes challenging, and retention rates remain low.

Web3 projects need tools and strategies to overcome these issues, and the festival presents one of the best opportunities for brand marketing and user acquisition.

Users, immersed in the ambiance of specific festive moments, exhibit peak curiosity and enthusiasm. Introducing engaging and creative activities during these occasions allows projects to boost `social interaction` and `user engagement`, stimulate `product promotion`, `strengthen brand awareness` and `customer loyalty`, and foster `community development` and interaction.&#x20;

Take the recent Christmas season, for instance. Numerous projects showcased their prowess, some offering generous prizes, while others initiated Christmas activities a month in advance.&#x20;
