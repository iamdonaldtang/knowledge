# How to Gain More Exposure？

### Join Epic

For some industry trends or major festivals, TaskOn launches Epic, and participating in such large-scale activities brings several benefits:

* Cross-Promotion: Collaborative activities involving different projects provide an opportunity for `cross-promotion`. Each project can leverage the user base of others to increase visibility, enhancing `brand exposure`. Major projects often participate in these large-scale events.
* Increased Exposure Opportunities: Large collaborative activities receive more exposure, featuring `main banners`, exclusive `landing page`, and more.
* Resource Sharing: Multiple projects can share resources, including `social media channels`, `technical support`, and various areas of expertise. This collaboration improves the efficiency and quality of the activities.
* Expanded User Base: Collaborative activities involving multiple projects bring together diverse user bases, expanding the overall `user reach`. This contributes to widespread event promotion and increased participation.
* Enhanced Attractiveness: Joint activities with multiple projects typically offer richer and more diverse rewards, increasing user motivation to participate. Users have the chance to earn various rewards from different projects, making the activities more appealing.

### Create Referrals

To ensure that your event reaches a broader audience, you can use the `Referrals` feature. Referrals can generate greater social effects within the event, increasing user engagement, enhancing the event's influence, and also aiding in expanding your user base through users' social networks.
