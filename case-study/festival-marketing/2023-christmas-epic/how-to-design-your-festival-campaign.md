# How to Design Your Festival Campaign?

### Task Design

The project, aiming to strengthen `brand awareness` and foster `community growth` through its Christmas campaign, opts for `off-chain tasks`, with a focus on social media engagement and other related aspects.

To ensure simplicity in task quantity and enhance `user conversion rates`, consider using the `Optional` and `Mandatory` feature. Designate tasks directly related to primary data growth as mandatory. Simultaneously, set less critical tasks as optional.

If your social media followers and community have reached a decent scale, and you aim to further grow your product's `user base`, setting campaigns as `on-chain tasks` is appropriate. Due to On-chain tasks come with a certain threshold, and TaskOn Points feature can assist in increasing user `conversion rates`.&#x20;

The points feature is directly linked to the `Leaderboard`, serving as a metric to assess user engagement and task completion. By leveraging the points system, you can effectively allocate rewards for your campaigns, ensuring that genuine users receive appropriate recognition.

Tips: Similarly, utilize the Optional/Mandatory feature, designating crucial On-chain tasks as mandatory and less critical ones as optional.

### Rewards Settings

In addition to task settings, you can enhance participation in campaigns by setting rewards.&#x20;

* Guaranteed

Both `Tokens` and `NFTs` support the option to pre-deposit rewards on TaskOn. Users are more inclined to engage in campaigns with explicit rewards, and pre-deposited rewards provide tangible and visible incentives.&#x20;

Campaigns with pre-deposited rewards will be remarked ‘`Guaranteed`’ on the explorer page, boosting click-through rates.

* Gas Free

`Gas free` activities reduce participation barriers, attracting more users, increasing satisfaction, and avoiding potentially lower conversion rates due to gas fees.

Campaigns with gas-free rewards will be remarked ‘Gas free' on the explorer webpage.



After creating campaigns, the key lies in devising effective `promotion strategies` to ensure the event gains broader exposure.&#x20;
