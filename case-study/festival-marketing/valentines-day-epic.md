# Valentine’s Day Epic

Many Web3 projects are facing numerous challenges in growth. The competition is intense for new projects, and the cost of acquiring users is high. Additionally, maintaining user retention and activity has become increasingly challenging. Therefore, Web3 project teams need to explore new ideas and approaches to drive project development. Valentine's Day, as an annual marketing opportunity, has become a powerful means to attract users and enhance brand visibility.

The battleground for growth and customer acquisition is highly competitive, and producing outcomes with similar or limited resources becomes crucial. TaskOn has successfully attracted a significant number of users for project teams through its uniquely designed Valentine's Day activity strategy. The activity's design not only offers abundant rewards but also leverages cross-project collaborations, maximizing the aggregation of traffic.&#x20;

### How TaskOn Achieved It

**Aggregate Rewards to Attract More Users**

In the process of user acquisition, TaskOn recognized that a single campaign's rewards might not be enticing enough. To address this, TaskOn employed a collaborative approach where rewards could be stacked and ultimately reach an exciting level. The Valentine's Day activity featured an impressive prize pool of up to 50K USDT, offering diverse rewards, including stablecoin incentives, CAP, NFTs, and more.

**Cross-promotion for Maximum Traffic Aggregation**

TaskOn strategically utilized cross-promotion to maximize traffic aggregation. Each project had its exclusive campaign page, facilitating better user engagement. Leveraging this, effective resource exchange was implemented. Collaborating projects seamlessly integrated each other's tasks within their exclusive campaigns, allowing users to engage with multiple projects simultaneously. This approach proved advantageous for mutual project promotion.

**Promotion with Big Names**

TaskOn's Valentine's Day activity also drew the active participation of big names in the industry, including projects like Sushi and 1inch. The participation of major projects enhances the project's credibility and recognition. Users are generally more inclined to engage in campaigns associated with projects that have industry acclaim and trust.

**Achieving Comprehensive Growth**

In addition to social media and community expansion, on-chain data growth is a critical component of project development. On-chain tasks facilitate deeper and traceable user engagement, contributing to a more dynamic project ecosystem.&#x20;

Analog’s recent initiative invited users to participate in the testnet, attracting over 20,000 participants. Additionally, there are tasks like SushiSwap's requirement to swap at least $10 and Orbiter Finance: 1/2/3 transactions of ETH with Arbitrum, etc.
