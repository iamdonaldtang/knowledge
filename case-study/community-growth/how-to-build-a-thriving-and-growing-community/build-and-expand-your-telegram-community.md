### How to Build and Expand Your Telegram Community Using TaskOn

Currently, on TaskOn, you can utilize the TaskOn Telegram Bot and the "Join Telegram" function.

Telegram doesn't have features like Discord Roles due to its different cultural focus; however, this doesn't undermine Telegram's robust user base, with a reported 800 million monthly active users. Perhaps your potential users are heavy Telegram users; inviting them to join your project's Telegram group ensures that she won't miss any updates while surfing on Telegram.
