Create a vibrant community where users are willing to contribute and actively promote it.

Your project has taken its first steps and is now in motion. However, reaching more people to make them aware of your product can be challenging with a limited team. How can you ensure that more individuals get to know your product and spontaneously spread the word?

The answer lies in building your Community.

Community members often serve as a project's most ardent supporters and advocates.&#x20;

A tightly-knit community consensus contributes to the sustainable development of a project. Members, driven by a sense of co-creation, not only help identify and address issues but also offer new ideas and suggestions. A robust community can become the engine for the project's self-improvement, consistently propelling its evolution.

Community members are often the most influential advocates for a project. Through their word of mouth and social media sharing, a project can quickly expand its visibility. This helps the project establish a positive and dynamic image, increasing awareness among the target audience.

Additionally, whether for institutions or individual investors, the community serves as a crucial indicator when evaluating the direct investment potential of a product.&#x20;

The larger and more diverse your community, the higher the credibility of your product, leading to increased efficiency in adoption.

### Market Choice: Discord & Telegram&#x20;

In the Web3 space, almost every project establishes its communities on Telegram and Discord. These two platforms have slight differences:
