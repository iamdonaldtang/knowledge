# Member List

Member Information and Management

The system includes information such as _Member Name_, _EVM Address_, _X_, _Discord_, _Telegram_, _Email_, _Joined Time_, and _Status_. You can filter user dimensions by selecting _All_, _Joined_, or _Left_.

Clicking on a user in the list displays their _User Info_ and _Task History_ in the right-hand menu bar.

* **User Info**: Displays the user’s X follower count, X account creation date, Discord join date, roles in Discord, Telegram join date, bound wallet address, and _EVM-Chain_ tags.\
  The _EVM-Chain_ tags include details based on the user’s highest nonce-bound wallet address, such as initial activity date, transaction count, current balance, total spent amount from the wallet, number of interactions with your contract, and the project assets held by the user.
* **Task History**: Shows which tasks the user has participated in within your community, including participation dates and earned rewards.

Member data can be exported as a CSV file or imported in bulk. This feature allows importing user data from other platforms into TaskOn. Currently, only _Zealy_ is supported, with more platforms to be added soon.
