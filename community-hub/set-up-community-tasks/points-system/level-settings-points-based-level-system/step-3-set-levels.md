# Step 3: Set Levels

Designing specific point thresholds for each level helps incentivize active participation in community tasks, boosting engagement and loyalty among members.&#x20;

This fosters a positive interactive community environment, enhancing cooperation and competition among members and ultimately driving community growth and development.&#x20;

Moreover, clear point thresholds enable members to better understand the requirements for leveling up, improving the efficiency of community tasks and encouraging active participation.&#x20;

Additionally, integrating incentive systems with level design further enhances engagement and motivation.&#x20;

By offering additional rewards or privileges, such as higher point multipliers, exclusive events or rewards, to users at specific levels, the community can encourage more active participation and strive for level advancement.&#x20;

Such incentive structures not only promote member activity but also strengthen their loyalty and sense of belonging to the community, facilitating continued community growth and expansion.

Levels can also be integrated with tasks. For instance, in task design, implementing tasks that are accessible only to users of specific levels can incentivize other users to level up.&#x20;

This approach fosters community development and enhances cohesion. (To implement this, please refer to the "`Condition`" section in the "_**Extra Settings**_" of task design.

### Customized

Under "Customized," the level system configuration is more flexible. If you don't want each level to require the same amount, or if you have already established your membership level system on another platform, you can choose "Customized" to seamlessly migrate your level system as is to TaskOn Community.

1. Click “`Customized`”, and enter the number of each level.
