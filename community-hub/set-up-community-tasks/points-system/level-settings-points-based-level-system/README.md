# Level Settings: Points-based Level System

## Overview

The community `member-level` system is an effective tool for community management and user interaction, shaping a positive, interactive, and `identity-driven` community environment.&#x20;

TaskOn Community provides a highly customizable platform for establishing member levels, allowing you to personalize your `membership structure`. If you have already established and operated a member-level system on other platforms, you can seamlessly migrate it to TaskOn Community.

## Benefits

* A comprehensive member-level system can motivate members to actively participate in the community and make contributions by providing rewards and privileges. Higher-level members may enjoy additional benefits, such as exclusive events, special badges, or other specific `privileges`.
* Different levels represent different community statuses, contributing to the establishment of a sense of community identity. Members may strive to elevate their levels as it signifies a higher status within the community, fostering a `closer connection` with the community.
* The level system can increase member `retention` and `loyalty`. In their efforts to advance their levels, members build a deeper sense of `engagement` and belonging.
* The member-level system generates data on member participation in the community. This data can be utilized to analyze member behavior and interests and provide targeted recommendations.
