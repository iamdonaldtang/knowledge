# Step 1: Define

To better tailor to your community and achieve your goals, it's crucial to rename "points".&#x20;

In the Web3, a points-based system is prevalent:

* GameFi games frequently use "`XP`" or "`EXP`".
* Linea community adopts "`LXP`" as the name for its level system, aligning with Linea's brand and community characteristics.

By selecting a name relevant to your community's theme or values, you can enhance members' sense of belonging and project identification. Such naming also sets your community apart and showcases its uniqueness and specialization.

1. Click "Level Settings"
2. Click Edit icon
3. Enter the name.

If you've already established a level system on another platform, you can seamlessly migrate it to TaskOn Community without any alterations. TaskOn Community offers a unified, convenient, and consistent management platform, enhancing community development and user engagement.
