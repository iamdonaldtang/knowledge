# Step 2: Default Task Points

### Default Points for Each Task

Setting default point for each task helps in designing the required points for `each level`.&#x20;

By comprehending the points assigned to individual tasks, you can better evaluate the total points members accumulate. This helps you determine the point thresholds for each level and ensure the level system's viability and equity. Hence, pre-setting default point for tasks serves as a crucial guideline for `level design` and `management`.

1. In Level Settings, click edit icon.
2. Enter the number.

### Flexibly Adjusting Task Points

Not every task has to be assigned a standard point. Within the task settings, you can tailor the reward structure by increasing or decreasing points accordingly.&#x20;

For instance, for more challenging tasks, offering higher points can incentivize user engagement and participation, while for simpler or routine tasks, it might be prudent to cap the total points available. This adaptable approach not only motivates users effectively, boosting participation and engagement, but also maintains balance and sustainability within the points system, ensuring fairness and longevity of operation.

For Point Rewards Settings, please refer to "_**Reward Settings**_".

_**Please note that the cumulative points accessible to users should not exceed the maximum point limit defined in your level system.**_
