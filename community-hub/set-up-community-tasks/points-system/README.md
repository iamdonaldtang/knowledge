# Points System

The task setup within the community primarily revolves around the points system and daily tasks.

The points system is the cornerstone of the community, effectively sustaining user engagement enthusiasm. On the TaskOn platform, project teams can establish multiple points systems to achieve diverse reward objectives.

The points system allows for the configuration of levels, specifying how many points are earned per task, how many points are required to advance to the next level, and the total number of levels. Points and levels serve as indicators of users’ contributions to the community.&#x20;

Communities can design incentives based on levels and points rankings, such as token rewards, whitelist or airdrop eligibility, exclusive NFT distribution, or Discord role assignments.

For example, you can configure a default reward of 10 points per completed task, with 500 points required to advance one level.&#x20;

Level progression does not need to be linear and can be freely customized. The level-up curve should be designed based on the difficulty of task completion, with the core goal of determining how many tasks a user must complete to become an influential contributor to the community. This approach informs the reward structure for users at different levels.

Rewards for community members are primarily distributed through points redemption or can be integrated into lucky wheel draws to increase points utilization.

Additionally, within the community, users can configure multiple points systems. By clicking _Add Points System_ on top of an existing points system, you can create additional systems to support varied reward structures.

For instance, you can establish a separate points category for on-chain tasks or for incentives tied to a specific event or task set. Different points systems can align with distinct value metrics, facilitating easier management and tailored reward designs for points-based incentives.
