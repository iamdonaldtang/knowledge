This design directly motivates the inviters by providing a reward for each successfully invited new user, increasing their enthusiasm for participating in invitation tasks.

### **Rewards by Tiers**

You can also set invitation tiers. For example, you can offer a certain reward for inviting more than 10 people and another reward for inviting more than 20 people.&#x20;

This design provides differential  levels of rewards based on the number or level of invitations. Typically, as the number of invitations increases, so does the reward. This encourages users to strive for higher invitation goals.
