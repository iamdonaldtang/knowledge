The Incentive Leaderboard is suitable for short-term rankings during specific holidays, anniversaries, or seasonal events within the community.&#x20;

By setting a start and end time for the period, it tracks user points rankings within the specified range, enabling targeted ranking incentives for specific activities.

The Incentive Leaderboard can incentivize specific points, offering Token rewards based on users’ points to further enhance their motivation to complete tasks.

You no longer need to worry about which tasks to add to the tasks; simply focus on the ranking. Points from all one-time tasks (without time restrictions) will be calculated at the start of the timed leaderboard. Members who completed tasks earlier will retain their points. Only actions performed during the timed leaderboard period will count toward repeatable tasks.

When setting up the Incentive Leaderboard, configure the recharge network, token, reward budget, ranking range for rewards, and token distribution mechanism. By default, rewards are deposited into the TaskOn platform and can be automatically distributed at the end of the event.

For example, if you plan to reward the top 100 users with 100U, select the token’s network, set the reward range and amount, choose between equal or random distribution mechanisms, and deposit the tokens into the TaskOn platform.

After setting the reward rules, you can provide additional reward distributions for users in different ranking tiers, such as setting rewards for ranks 100–200.
