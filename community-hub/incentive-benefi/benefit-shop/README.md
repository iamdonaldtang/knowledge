# Benefit Shop

To further incentivize and reward active members of the projects’ community, we’re introducing the Benefit Shop. Upon accumulating certain points, members can exchange them for various rewards in the Benefit Shop, including **Token**, **NFTs**, **Discord Role**, **Whitelists**, **Content**, **Promote Code**, **Ticket**, and more. The specific rewards are determined by the project creators.

The Benefit Shop not only provides rewards but also serves as recognition for members’ contributions, enhancing their sense of value and importance within the community.&#x20;
