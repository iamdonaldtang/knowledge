# Token

If your token has already been launched, you can directly allow members to convert their community points into your token through token benefits, thus increasing circulation.&#x20;

If your token hasn't been launched yet, or if you prefer to use another token such as a stablecoin, the process is the same.&#x20;

## Set Up

### Basic info

Select network, token name, and enter the number of total reward amount.

Please be aware that if you opt for "`Token`" as your benefit, ensure your assets cover the cost. If your balance falls short, please **deposit funds** beforehand.

When setting the exchange rate, please pay attention to the following:

**Value Balance**: Ensure that the set redeem rate reflects the actual value relationship between points and tokens. If the exchange rate is unreasonable, it may lead to users' feeling unfair or cause system instability.

**Market Demand**: Consider the demand for points and tokens from members, as well as the market's acceptance of both. The redeem rate should meet the needs of users while also considering market reactions.

**Incentive Mechanism**: The redeem rate can be part of the incentive mechanism to guide user behavior. For example, setting a more favorable redeem rate to encourage members to engage in specific activities or consumption.

**Sustainability**: Ensure that the set redeem rate can sustain the system. A too high redeem rate may deplete resources, while a too low redeem rate may fail to attract users to the system.
