# Milestone

The Milestone feature, located within the Incentive Center, provides communities with a customizable user achievement system to flexibly reward core contributors. Participation conditions can be set for Milestones, enabling more precise recognition of community contributors.

Milestones primarily support rewards based on points and levels. Points-based rewards can be configured to accumulate towards a goal over a specified time period.

Once a Milestone activity is published, users who meet the set requirements can claim rewards directly, making it easier to incentivize participation in community building.

* Example: Projects can customize points thresholds (e.g., 10 points) or level thresholds (e.g., Level 5).
* Diverse reward types are supported: Token, Discord roles, points, etc.
