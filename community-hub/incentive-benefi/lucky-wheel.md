This is another use case for extending the application of user points, allowing users to participate in a lucky wheel draw by spending points. The winning probability can be set based on the proportion of points consumed.

When setting the winning probability and points required for the draw, consider the prize value. Use the principle of “matching the prize value to the consumed points value” to establish the reward mechanism. It is recommended to set small rewards with a relatively high winning probability to boost user participation and engagement.

You can configure various prize types, including: `Token`, `NFT`, `DiscordRole`, `Whitelist`, `Content`, `Promote Code`, `Ticket`

Each prize category can have its name, token value, and quantity specified.&#x20;

For example:

Set the points consumed per draw, with the points designed based on the reward value.

For instance, if the prize pool includes only 0.01 ETH with a 10% winning probability, on average, a user might win a Token after approximately 10 draws.&#x20;

If 0.01 ETH ≈ 36U, the draw system should be planned around 3.6U per draw, calculating how many points are equivalent to 3.6U to structure the draw system accordingly.
