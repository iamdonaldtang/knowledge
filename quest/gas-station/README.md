# Gas Station

`Gas fees` are a crucial factor influencing `user conversion rates`. Users may be attracted to your activity by compelling poster designs and enticing rewards, but some might abandon participation due to concerns about incurring gas fees, ultimately closing the activity interface.&#x20;

TaskOn `Gas Station` addresses this concern for users. By leveraging the Gas Station functionality, projects can cover the gas fees incurred when users claim rewards, allowing them to access rewards without any cost. This advantage not only helps alleviate users' financial burden but also reduces the likelihood of user attrition during the activity period. Such a strategic move provides projects with a tangible competitive edge, encouraging users to actively participate and reap the benefits of the activity. Ultimately, this drives up project engagement and user involvement.
