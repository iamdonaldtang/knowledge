# Where to Check the Gas Balance

### Check Total Balance

In “`Entity Hub`”, click on “`Gas Station`”, and you check your Gas balance. You can also select the reward type and estimate the approximate number of available gas free spots based on your current balance.

### Gas Station History

You can check the "`History`" section at the bottom of the page to review records of your deposit and usage.

### Insufficient Gas Balance

For **FCFS** gas free campaigns/events, due to the `real-time fluctuations` in `gas fees`, the pre-deposited gas fee may be **insufficient**. TaskOn will send you timely reminders via both `Notification` and `Email` when the gas fee balance is `less than 20%`. This ensures an optimal user experience in participating in campaigns/events.

You can also refer to the `process bar` in your ongoing campaigns/events page to check the gas fee balance if your campaigns/events set unlimited winners.

### Gas Fee Refund&#x20;

If the gas fee required for award distribution is less than the initially deducted amount, TaskOn will refund the remaining gas to your Gas Station account after all rewards have been successfully distributed.
