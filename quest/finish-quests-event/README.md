# Finish Quests/Event

When your campaign ends, it’s important to check the campaign result to `analyze` the effect of your campaigns, like the amount of `visitors`, `participants`, `qualifiers` & `winners` of campaigns, the `user conversion rate`, etc. For now, you can click `Creator’s Center`, go to Campaign and click the button to download the campaign data.

You will get the data like user addresses, Twitter `Handles`, `user types`, etc. But, if you need more data to do analysis, contact us for detail data.

Similarly, timely reward distribution can enhance user `satisfaction` and `engagement`, cultivate positive brand perception, and foster `long-term relationships` with users. TaskOn provides a comprehensive `reward distribution system` to help you efficiently fulfill rewards and achieve rapid award distribution.
