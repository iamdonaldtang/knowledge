# Upload Qualifiers

If you add PoW tasks in your campaign & choose distributing rewards by TaskOn, it’s necessary for you to upload the qualifiers list for each Power of Work task after the campaign ends.

And it’s very important for user experience and create a good impression on you.

1. Click `Entity Hub`, go to `Campaign`, locate the campaign and click `Please Upload Qualified Address Lists of 1 Tasks`.
