# Trading Race

A newly launched feature on TaskOn, the trading competition module is available in the announcement section, allowing you to set competition rules. You can configure the total prize pool, swap targets, requirements, and eligibility criteria. Multiple prize pools can be established within a trading competition, with each pool supporting different ranking rules.

The page can be customized to match the project team’s needs, including editing the competition name, start and end times, dynamic effects, and banner image effects.

You can set rankings based on trading volume, with prize distribution determined by the leaderboard. This incentivizes and encourages users to participate in the trading competition.
