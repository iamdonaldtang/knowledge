#### **Lucky Draw：**

After the task ends, the system will randomly select winners from eligible users based on the set target. Each winner will receive rewards through the lucky draw method.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe69vdfEkNDu47yETR0EarPYgvxsbQMZNpBt5twXxvjsP2Dxwgw6ihPt1wTrudXnKlC34K9tRHAjVQoQ4fRtgjiV82PFkhEvNzbdsuK5bXrFJ6dqcPDfD6-Hc7U5LVLARnHC04CqA?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **Ranking：**

Winners are determined based on accumulated task points. Each winner will receive rewards based on their ranking.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc-gqtrJ0kENio_nm5mNvdpEyOmTnAtGeWycDfpgW2FeTR4beRvbIrmTLaL0oYdlwvtO_AxqiwviaLZ1-SBybVpqWXFC2u1v1o5GbSIHjuYqSB6hm64Y0yJqebS6H5CeHwzFvsCTA?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For the ranking method, there are two approaches: `Top Number` and `Top Percentage`.

Top Number: The top-ranked participants, specifying the exact ranking positions of submitters. For example, submitters ranked from 1st to 5th will be designated as winners.

Top Percentage: Specifies the top percentile range of submitters’ rankings, e.g., top 10% to top 20%, meaning submitters ranked between the top 10% and top 20% are eligible for rewards.

The ranking method can be layered. For example, you can set rewards for the top 10 ranks and then additional rewards for ranks 11 to 20, allowing segmented reward settings based on needs.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXef51qsg7l5gwm4r7Pjl_xvRVtCta1qujSZ6nDz6DgVQLMnjY0i0HBl_SNonJt-qdzYL8MwTn6SEWEYSXO724hNXtojdHlQhecjCNPxiyKNVpZz3fZXFvvna3geD3icX81-X5dL?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;However, `Top Number` and _`Top Percentage`_ cannot be set simultaneously. Within the same category, multiple ranking rules can be set for segmented rewards.

#### **FCFS：**

Based on the first-come, first-served principle, users who participate early and meet the target will receive rewards first until the reward pool is depleted.



#### **Open to All：**

Every eligible participant will receive all types of rewards through the “open to all” draw method.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcaMiajqLDycXN2vngDA-9uF7mTDzww4r-RnlSEuMOyb6JchGUZijgbWDmy6AKlp5UUWxG5kSchjU-vOcPOSN6kBgI8t91GYYHojLqwXWongrWFtI_iM10cJQTPRKGyPU7Gklhu4g?key=0Ugs8HwP_vZfQwQiqIZ9vA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When setting the draw method, you can combine multiple modes to customize different reward content based on varying needs.

For example: _Lucky Draw + FCFS_, _Lucky Draw + Open to All_, _Top Percentage + Open to All_. However, _Lucky Draw_ and _FCFS_ cannot be set simultaneously with _Ranking_

## **Reward Content**

Rewards include: _Token_, _Points_, _NFT_, _Whitelist_, and _Discord Role_.

### Rewards Type

<table><thead><tr><th width="157">Type</th><th>Intro</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Token</td><td><code>Tokens</code> are essential for driving user participation by offering direct incentives. When users receive tokens as rewards for completing tasks, it motivates active involvement and attracts more participants. This rewarding mechanism boosts user satisfaction and fosters loyalty, encouraging regular <code>engagement</code> in platform campaigns. As users accumulate tokens through task completion, they become more invested in the platform, resulting in increased overall engagement and a thriving community of participants.</td></tr><tr><td>NFT</td><td><code>NFT</code> (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset, and using NFTs as rewards has the advantages of uniqueness, authenticity, and scarcity, providing users with more valuable and meaningful reward experiences.</td></tr><tr><td>Whitelist</td><td>As a reward, the <code>whitelist</code> offers unique value and experiences, enhancing user engagement, loyalty, and brand awareness. This, in turn, fosters the growth and expansion of your project. These privileged users enjoy a sense of recognition and belonging within your project, strengthening their bond with the brand.</td></tr><tr><td>Points</td><td><p>We've introduced a brand-new reward type: <code>Points</code>. This innovative reward system adds a gamified experience to your TaskOn platform campaigns, motivating users to accomplish tasks and accumulate points. Beyond that, points offer you the capability to fashion a personalized points system aligned with your project's objectives. By fine-tuning point values and redemption choices, you can amplify user engagement and nurture loyalty. Furthermore, the aggregation of user points serves as a gauge of participants' engagement level, aiding your project in pinpointing a committed community of actively involved and supportive users.</p><p><br>Currently, TaskOn supports two methods for setting points: <code>Set  Points On Campaign</code> and <code>Set Points On Each Task</code>.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Discord Role</td><td>TaskOn now supports <code>Discord</code> roles as campaign rewards, providing a more efficient way to incentivize community engagement. By adding the TaskOn <code>bot</code> to your Discord server, you can effortlessly implement a streamlined reward process.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Token：**

The most direct incentive reward, project tokens, and stablecoins like USDC are highly popular among users. They can boost user enthusiasm, enhance satisfaction, and foster loyalty and long-term participation.

Select the Network, Token Name, Total Reward Amount, Number of Winners, and How to distribute rewards：Equally or Randomly.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/截屏2025-07-31 11.13.57.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Deposit the rewards into TaskOn in advance, and the frontend will display that the rewards have been deposited into TaskOn and will be distributed by TaskOn. If not deposited, the project team will distribute the rewards independently.

After successfully setting the rewards, you can choose to add `Customized Bonus for Quest Winners` by entering additional reward information in the text field.

You can also set a `Points Bonus for Quest Qualifiers` to provide extra point rewards for winning users.

#### **Points：**

A point system established within the community, where points are interoperable across the same project, community, and Quests. Points are used to measure contributions to the community. In each Quest, users can earn a certain number of points by completing tasks. When accumulated tasks meet the preset reward criteria, users receive point rewards.

Points have relatively lower value and are recommended to be used primarily with the _Ranking_ incentive mode.

**NFT：**

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that offer advantages such as uniqueness, authenticity, and scarcity as rewards, providing users with a more valuable and meaningful reward experience.

You can deposit NFTs into the platform from other sources or mint NFTs on TaskOn and choose how to distribute them.
