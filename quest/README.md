# Quest

Using the `Campaig`n feature on `TaskOn`, you can configure task templates according to different objectives to attract various types of users to participate in campaigns.&#x20;

For example, if you want to increase your project's social media account data, you can set up an SNS-exclusive campaign, including tasks like following Twitter and reposting.&#x20;

If you aim to increase community data, you can set tasks to participate in Telegram or Discord. For deeper `community management` and user `lifecycle management`, you can utilize [TaskOn's GTC version](https://taskoncommunitys-organization.gitbook.io/guide-book).

## Benefits

* Increased exposure: Campaigns on TaskOn not only effectively gather traffic for your own project but also attract traffic from other projects on TaskOn, achieving a cross-traffic effect.
* Reduced user education costs: The high barrier and poor user experience of Web3 result in high customer acquisition costs. Users on TaskOn have a natural Web3 foundation, reducing the cost of user education.
* Less workload: TaskOn offers a rich variety of task templates, most of which support automatic verification. This greatly saves the time of operations personnel, allowing them to focus more on growth.
