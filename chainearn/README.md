# ChainEarn

ChainEarn module operates as a customized CPS advertising model, delivering results-driven outcomes — whether increasing token holders or boosting swap volumes — with three critical advantages:

Rapid efficacy

Minimal capital risk

Low operational overhead

**Even if initial targets deviate from final outcomes:**

Projects only pay for achieved results;

All participation still generates zero-cost brand exposure.

**By creating precision-targeted, long-duration OnChain Tasks — requiring users to buy/sell specific token amounts on designated DEXs — ChainEarn:**

↑ On-chain transaction frequency

↑ DEX trading volume & holding addresses

↑ Average token holding duration

Stimulates buy/sell market activity

Breaks the death spiral of low liquidity → high slippage

Enhances community engagement & topical relevance

Attracts new external users
